# PDF2AudioBook
**Introduction:**
I have created a pdf to audiobook which will serve the purpose of saving time for people who need to listen to their audiobook, research paper or any type of PDF file while they are in transit, having a morning walk, driving etc. This will help people get their reading task done easily without having to carry a physical book, phone or laptop.

**How it works:**
We are extracting the text from the pdf document and later we are cleaning the text to align it in proper format. This converted text in string format is being passed on to “pyttsx3” to convert it to speech in real-time.
